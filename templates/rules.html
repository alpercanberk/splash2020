      <h2 class="card-title">New Feature - Ability Codes </h2>
      During the game, there will be rare “ability codes” hidden around campus. Entering these codes in the user’s “ability code” section will give the user one of 4 special abilities: temporary immunity, revival, Water blasters or qualification for the Finals.
        <div>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Immunity:</strong>
        These codes grant the user a short period of immunity. If the user is splashed while immune, they are not obligated to give their code to their hunter.
        Additional rules/tips
        Immunity codes cannot be used by a player after they are splashed. If the hunter of a user
        It’s not prohibited to lie about having immunity</li>

        <li><strong>Revival:</strong>
        This code allows you to revive yourself or a friend. It can be used after you are eliminated from the game.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Water Blasters:</strong>
          This code will allow you to use a water blaster (provided by the Splash Ops) for the duration of time you are in the game. If the person holding the blaster gets eliminated, the eliminator is the new holder of the blaster.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Qualification for Finals:</strong>
        If you use one of these codes, you will be immediately advanced to the finals
