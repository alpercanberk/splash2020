        "You must have your splash code on you at all times. When you get splashed, you must show the splasher your code so that they can input it into the website to get their next target. The splasher now attempts to pursue their next target. If a code is not working, try switching a zero with the letter O and vice versa before you email the Splashmasters.",
        "You may only splash someone with water (no sodas, juices, etc.). You can use whatever method you want (water bottles, water guns, water balloons, and more but nothing that will harm someone else).",
        "You may not block someone from splashing another person in any way (holding them back, intentionally blocking a doorway, etc).",
        "No splashing indoors or within 10 feet of a building's entrance.",
        "No splashing someone outside of Lawrenceville’s gates (Main Street, Princeton, New York City, home, etc.)",
        "No splashing your target if they are at a required school commitment (no sports practices/games, theatre/SDC rehearsals, lectures). However, you may splash them on their way to and from these events. In addition, you cannot splash a tour guide while they are giving a tour and you cannot splash someone if they are watching a home sports event. However, you may splash them on their way to and from these events.",
        "No stealing/destroying property in order to splash your target (aka no blackmailing or taking people's things).",
        "No splashing outside Lville gates (including Main St.)",
        "You cannot lie to the Splashmasters, including lying about practice times or other commitments to be “safe” from Splash.",
