        "You must have your splash code on you at all times. When you get splashed, you must show the splasher your code so that they can input it into the website to get their next target. The splasher now attempts to pursue their next target. If a code is not working, try switching a zero with the letter O and vice versa before you email the Splashmasters.",
        "You may only splash someone with water (no sodas, juices, etc.). You can use whatever method you want (water bottles, water guns, water balloons, and more but nothing that will harm someone else).",

        "No splashing your target if they are at a required school commitment (no sports practices/games, theatre/SDC rehearsals, lectures). However, you may splash them on their way to and from these events. In addition, you cannot splash a tour guide while they are giving a tour and you cannot splash someone if they are watching a home sports event. However, you may splash them on their way to and from these events.",
